What varies from the latest iteration( a lot )

Motors_JMP:

-Added compensations so motors go as fast negative as they go positive
-This only works for the 20% load
-To work for the 20% working range comment scalar multiplication and uncomment line before
-To change back to 20% recomment line and uncomment scalar multiplication


Backwards - General_JMP:

-Added function that allows you to go back a proportional amount that you go forwards
-(Will add amount of time for it to saturate)
-Added the function to the General header.
