# Rumarino-2016-2017

Here we will hold the work gathered from the 19th of December onwards

Work Listed in order:
1. Imported current arduino drivers for pressure sensor and imu.
2. Imported MSP430 proprietary libraries.
3. Started the pressure sensor beta software for the msp430.
4. Re-wrote I2C code to be more general, include NACK and multiple transactions - Not tested.
5. Wrote the code for the beta - Not tested.
6. Added typecasts to code - Not tested but builds.
7. Verify that Pressure sensor PROM directions are correct.
8. Tested modified I2C drivers, they seem to work. Have to further test.
9. Pressure sensor drivers seem to work. Further testing needed.
10. Started Razer IMU Beta drivers.
11. Modified Serial drivers to include USB and Pin UART protocols. Need to test.
12. Created Motor driver for 4 motor and 2 motor configurations. Need to test.
13. Simplified motor speed register value calculation. Need to test.
